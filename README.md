# hack-a-thing-2-unitynetworking

## Description
In preparation for our project, we decided to focus our Hack-A-Thing on exploring Unity Networks. Unity NetCode is a Unity's new networking package that provides a dedicated server model with client protection in order to create multi-player games. We also spent time learning more about networks in general in order to understand the mechanisms behind the tutorial.
