# hack-a-thing-2-unitynetworking

## Description
In preparation for our project, we decided to focus our Hack-A-Thing on exploring Unity Networks. Unity NetCode is a Unity's new networking package that provides a dedicated server model with client protection in order to create multi-player games. We also spent time learning more about networks in general in order to understand the mechanisms behind the tutorial. 

## Who Did What
John Brady - typer
Amber Liu - driver  

## What We Learned
* Basic understanding of Unity NetCode and client-server networking (Unity NetCode is new, so there's not a lot of documentation)
* Unity Git flow

## What Didn't Work
* Debugger doesn't show the correct port


## Tutorials
